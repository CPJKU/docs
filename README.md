# The _Match Documentation_ Website 

This repository contains the code for creating the CPJKU Documentation website.
You can find the latest version of the website on [https://cpjku.github.io/docs/](https://cpjku.github.io/docs/). 


### General Instructions 

When you change a file and push your changes then the website will be automatically updated.
The website is created using the Hugo Book Template Theme and Wowchemy.
A github action builds this page to the gh-pages branch.


Hugo extended 0.83.1 is required to build this website. You can download it [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.83.1)

To view your changes locally use:
```shell

hugo server
```
You can copy `//localhost:1313/` in your browser to visualize locally the website and your ongoing changes.
